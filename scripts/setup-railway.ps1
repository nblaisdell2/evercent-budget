# 2) link this folder to the Railway project named in .railway/railway.ts
#    (creates it only after you confirm, or with -Yes)
# 3) railway config plan (shown), then railway config apply
#    -> Postgres, the web service (GitHub source, Dockerfile, health check,
#       pre-deploy migrations, DATABASE_URL reference)
# 4) wait for the first deploy (stops with the push command if main isn't pushed yet)
# 5) generate the *.up.railway.app domain; attach CUSTOM_DOMAIN if one is set
# 6) print the live HTTPS URL (+ DNS records still needed for a custom domain)
#
#   -Yes   don't prompt: create the project if missing and pass --yes to
#          `railway config apply`. Destructive changes are never auto-confirmed.
