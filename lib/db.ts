 * collect metadata, and we must not require DATABASE_URL just to import this
 * file — only when a query actually runs.
 *
 * In development, Next.js hot-reloads modules, which would otherwise create a
 * new Pool on every reload and exhaust connections, so we stash it on the
 * Node global to survive reloads.
 *
 * Connection config comes entirely from environment variables:
 *   DATABASE_URL  locally: from .env (written by `npm run setup`)
 *                 on Railway: a reference to the Postgres service's
 *                 DATABASE_URL, declared in .railway/railway.ts
 *   DATABASE_SSL  "disable" (default) or "require" — see buildSsl() below
